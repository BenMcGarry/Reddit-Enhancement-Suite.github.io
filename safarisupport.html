<h1>Safari Support</h1>

<p>As of RES v5.2.2, Safari is no longer a supported browser. Please see <a href="https://medium.com/@honestbleeps/what-apple-gives-you-for-100-as-a-safari-extension-developer-and-why-reddit-enhancement-suite-6e2d829c2e52" title="What Apple gives you for $100 as a Safari Extension Developer — and why Reddit Enhancement Suite may cease support for Safari">here</a> for more information on this decision as well as below for more information.</p>

<h3>Why did we do it?</h3>

<p>Dropping Safari support was <strong>never solely about money</strong> as many think it is, <strong>we do not have a vendetta against Apple</strong>. The discussion lasted many weeks over the future of Safari support, it was not something we took lightly. </p>
    
<p>It ultimately came down to the direction the development of Safari extensions was heading. Major browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox were all adopting a standard commonly known as "WebExtensions". The provides a single API across all browsers. This is hugely beneficial as you can develop for all major browsers from a single code base. Safari is not adopting this standard and instead moving to their own format, with strong reliance on Xcode. This would require significant investment from the development team to support the browser, as well as core developers having access to Xcode.</p>

<p>Below are common statements on the discontinuation of Safari as well as the answer to them.</p>

<h3>"It was all about the money"</h3>
<p>No it was not, whilst we do not like the $100 charge due to our past experiences with Apple as discussed in the post linked above. We would be willing to pay it if Safari adopted the extensions standard.</p>

<h3>"The RES team have a vendetta against Apple"</h3>
<p>Again, no we do not. The finial decision was a group one and we stand by it. Many of the core developers use Apple devices on a daily basis for personal or work.</p>

<h3>"Apple does it X way for good user experiences and battery efficiency"</h3>
<p>Whilst it is true that Safari is generally better for battery life and UX on the macOS platform, this does not help us with having RES on the platform.</p>
